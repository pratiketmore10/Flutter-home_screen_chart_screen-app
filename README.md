Flutter Home Screen and Chart Screen App

This assignment is for creating two screens using Flutter in Visual Studio Code:

Home Screen: This screen contains a button that navigates to the Chart Screen using go_router and flutter_riverpod.
Chart Screen: This screen displays a bar chart for demonstration purposes.

Features:

Home Screen: A basic screen with a button that navigates to the Chart Screen.
Chart Screen: A screen that displays a chart using data fetched from an API.

Technologies:

go_router: For navigation between the Home Screen and Chart Screen.
flutter_riverpod: For state management, particularly to manage data fetched from an external API.
charts_flutter: For displaying a bar chart (or another type of chart) on the Chart Screen.

Implementation Steps:

Define two routes using go_router for navigation between the screens.
Use flutter_riverpod to fetch data from an API and manage state.
Display the fetched data using a chart (like a bar chart) on the Chart Screen.

Instructions:

Run the command flutter run in the terminal to see the output of this code.
